## üìù Description

 </div>

The Travel App is a user-centric CRUD application built using Express.js and MongoDB (Mongoose). It incorporates Google OAuth Authentication for streamlined login access. The app aims to simplify the packing process and trip planning. Its main functionality revolves around enabling users to create trip cards with details such as location, duration of stay, and trip type. Once a trip is saved, users can create a checklist of items, conveniently displayed on the right side of the screen.
